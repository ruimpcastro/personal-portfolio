Responsive Portfolio Design.

Hello my name is Rui Castro, im 25 years old and currently im finishing my university degree in Informatics.

Im currently also doing The Odin Project Curriculum to get a better understanding on how to code on both front-end and back-end of a project.

This Portfolio will have all of my developed projects on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, NodeJS Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

It will be incremented as long as I develop new projects.

It will have all of the projects that i made from my first day in GitHub until now.
